# Manual Fulfillment Feature Implementation

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✓ Complete

---

## Overview

Added the ability to manually create fulfillments for orders through a user-friendly form interface. Users can now:

1. Click "Fulfil Items" button on unfulfilled order items
2. Select which items and quantities to fulfill
3. Create partial or complete fulfillments
4. Automatically update order state when fully fulfilled

---

## Components Implemented

### 1. Routes

**File**: `config/routes.rb`

Added nested fulfillment routes under orders:

```ruby
resources :orders, only: [:index, :show] do
  # ...existing routes...

  # Fulfillments for orders
  resources :fulfillments, only: [:new, :create]
end
```

**Routes Created**:

- `GET /orders/:order_id/fulfillments/new` - Display fulfillment form
- `POST /orders/:order_id/fulfillments` - Create fulfillment

---

### 2. Controller

**File**: `app/controllers/fulfillments_controller.rb`

**Actions**:

#### `new`

- Loads unfulfilled items with quantity > 0 and fulfillable
- Initializes quantities at 100% (full unfulfilled quantity)
- Redirects if no unfulfilled items exist

#### `create`

- Validates selected quantities
- Creates `Fulfillment` record
- Creates `FulfillmentLineItem` records for each selected item
- Updates order state to `fulfilled` if fully fulfilled
- Logs activity
- Redirects back to order show page

**Key Features**:

- Transaction safety (rollback on errors)
- Quantity validation (can't exceed unfulfilled quantity)
- Automatic order state transition
- Activity logging
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

---

### 3. Views

**File**: `app/views/fulfillments/new.html.erb`

**UI Components**:

1. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Orders → Order Name → Fulfil Items
2. **Header Card**: Shows total unfulfilled items count
3. **Item List**: For each unfulfilled item shows:
   - Product image (framed preview if available)
   - Product name and SKU
   - Frame details (from variant mapping)
   - Production cost
   - Quantity selector with min/max validation
   - Quick "None" and "All" buttons
4. **Form Actions**:
   - Cancel button (returns to order)
   - Create Fulfillment button with dynamic item count
5. **Info Card**: Explains fulfillment functionality

**Interactive Features**:

- Live quantity total update in form footer
- Quick select buttons (None/All) for each item
- Number inputs with min/max constraints

**File**: `app/views/orders/show.html.erb`

Added "Fulfil Items" button at bottom of unfulfilled items card:

- Only shows when no items have mapping issues
- Full-width blue button with icon
- Links to fulfillment form

---

## User Flow

### Step 1: View Order

User sees unfulfilled items on order show page with yellow "Unfulfilled" badge.

### Step 2: Click "Fulfil Items"

At bottom of unfulfilled items card, click "Fulfil Items" button.

### Step 3: Select Items & Quantities

- All items pre-selected at full unfulfilled quantity
- Adjust quantities as needed
- Use "None" to deselect, "All" to select full quantity
- Live count updates in footer

### Step 4: Create Fulfillment

Click "Create Fulfillment" button to submit.

### Step 5: Confirmation

- Redirected to order show page
- Success message displayed
- Items moved to fulfilled section
- Order state updated if fully fulfilled

---

## Validation & Error Handling

### Client-Side

- Number inputs with `min="0"` and `max="unfulfilled_quantity"`
- Live validation prevents invalid inputs

### Server-Side

1. **Empty Selection**: Must select at least one item with quantity > 0
2. **Quantity Overflow**: Cannot fulfill more than unfulfilled quantity
3. **Transaction Safety**: All database changes wrapped in transaction
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Errors logged and user-friendly messages shown

---

## Integration with Existing System

### Works With:

- ✓ Existing `Fulfillment` and `FulfillmentLineItem` models
- ✓ Order state machine (triggers `fulfill` event when complete)
- ✓ Activity logging system
- ✓ Fulfillment display on order show page
- ✓ Partial fulfillment support (existing system design)

### Does NOT:

- ✗ Sync to Shopify (manual fulfillments are internal only)
- ✗ Add tracking information (tracking fields not in form)
- ✗ Send customer notifications (no email trigger)
- ✗ Specify location (location fields not included)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:

1. **Tracking Information**: Add optional tracking fields to form
2. **Shopify Sync**: Option to sync manual fulfillments back to Shopify
3. **Bulk Actions**: "Fulfil All" button to skip form
4. **Location Selection**: Choose fulfillment location
5. **Notes**: Add notes to fulfillment records
6. **Email Notifications**: Trigger customer notification emails
7. **Shipping Labels**: Generate/attach shipping labels

---

## Database Schema

No schema changes required. Uses existing tables:

### `fulfillments`

- `order_id` - Links to order
- `status` - Set to "success" for manual fulfillments
- `fulfilled_at` - Timestamp of fulfillment creation

### `fulfillment_line_items`

- `fulfillment_id` - Links to fulfillment
- `order_item_id` - Links to order item
- `quantity` - Quantity fulfilled

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:

- `app/controllers/fulfillments_controller.rb`
- `app/views/fulfillments/new.html.erb`
- `guides/MANUAL_FULFILLMENT_FEATURE.md`

### Modified:

- `config/routes.rb` - Added fulfillment routes
- `app/views/orders/show.html.erb` - Added "Fulfil Items" button

---

## Style Consistency

All UI elements follow the existing design system:

- Tailwind CSS classes
- SVG icon helper usage
- Color scheme (blue-600 for primary actions, yellow-200 for unfulfilled)
- Card-based layouts
- Form styling matches other forms
- Button styles consistent with app

---

## Security Considerations

✓ **Authentication**: `authenticate_user!` before_action  
✓ **Authorization**: Orders scoped to `current_user.stores`  
✓ **SQL Injection**: Uses ActiveRecord, parameterized queries  
✓ **Mass Assignment**: Strong parameters not needed (no nested attributes)  
✓ **Transaction Safety**: Database changes wrapped in transaction

---

## Deployment Notes

No migrations required. Feature ready to deploy.

**Rollback Plan**:

- Remove routes from `config/routes.rb`
- Delete `app/controllers/fulfillments_controller.rb`
- Revert changes to `app/views/orders/show.html.erb`
