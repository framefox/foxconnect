# Complete Fulfillment System - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✓ Fully Implemented - Inbound & Outbound Sync Complete

---

## System Overview

A complete bi-directional fulfillment tracking system that:

1. **Receives** Shopify fulfillment webhooks (inbound)
2. **Creates** local fulfillment records
3. **Syncs back** to Shopify (outbound) with tracking info
4. **Displays** fulfillments in Shopify-style UI

---

## Complete Data Flow

```
External Fulfillment → Shopify Webhook → FoxConnect → Sync Back → Shopify Admin
                           ↓                 ↓              ↓
                     Inbound Service   Local Storage   Outbound Service
```

### Detailed Flow

1. **External party fulfills** order (warehouse, 3PL, etc.)
2. **Shopify sends webhook** → `POST /fulfillments/create`
3. **InboundFulfillmentService** processes webhook:
   - Creates local `Fulfillment` record
   - Creates `FulfillmentLineItem` records
   - Matches items via `shopify_remote_line_item_id`
   - Updates order state to `fulfilled` if complete
   - Logs "Fulfillment Created" activity
4. **OutboundFulfillmentService** syncs back to Shopify:
   - Queries Shopify for fulfillment orders
   - Matches line items
   - Creates fulfillment with tracking info
   - Logs "Fulfillment Synced to Shopify" activity
5. **Merchant sees tracking** in Shopify admin
6. **Customer** receives tracking email from Shopify

## Services Architecture

### InboundFulfillmentService

**File**: `app/services/inbound_fulfillment_service.rb`

**Responsibilities**:

- ✓ Process Shopify webhook payloads
- ✓ Create local fulfillment records
- ✓ Match Shopify line items to local order items
- ✓ Update order fulfillment state
- ✓ Log activities
- ✓ **Trigger outbound sync**

**Key Methods**:

- `create_fulfillment` - Main entry point
- `update_fulfillment` - Handle updates
- `sync_to_shopify` - Triggers OutboundFulfillmentService

### OutboundFulfillmentService

**File**: `app/services/outbound_fulfillment_service.rb`

**Responsibilities**:

- ✓ Query Shopify order for fulfillment orders
- ✓ Match local items to Shopify fulfillment order line items
- ✓ Create fulfillment in Shopify via GraphQL
- ✓ Send tracking information
- ✓ Log success/failure activities
- ✓ Handle errors gracefully

**Key Methods**:

- `sync_to_shopify` - Main entry point
- `fetch_shopify_fulfillment_orders` - GraphQL query
- `build_line_items_payload` - Line item matching
- `create_shopify_fulfillment` - GraphQL mutation

---

## GraphQL Integration

### Queries Used

**Fetch Fulfillment Orders**:

```graphql
query ($orderId: ID!) {
  order(id: $orderId) {
    fulfillmentOrders(query: "status:open OR status:in_progress") {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          lineItems {
            id
            lineItem {
              id
            }
            remainingQuantity
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Mutations Used

**Create Fulfillment**:

```graphql
mutation fulfillmentCreate($fulfillment: FulfillmentInput!) {
  fulfillmentCreate(fulfillment: $fulfillment) {
    fulfillment {
      id
      status
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Shopify Client Setup

```ruby
ShopifyAPI::Clients::Graphql::Admin.new(
  session: ShopifyAPI::Auth::Session.new(
    shop: store.shopify_domain,
    access_token: store.shopify_token
  )
)
```

---

## UI Changes

### OrderItemCard Enhancements

**New Prop**: `readOnly`

**Behavior**:

- **Draft orders**: Full editing (Remove, Replace product/image)
- **In Production/Fulfilled**: Read-only (no editing controls)
- **Fulfilled items**: Always read-only
- **Removed items**: Restore button only in Draft state

### Conditional Display

**Draft/Cancelled Orders**:

- Shows: "To be fulfilled by Framefox" grouping
- Allows: Full editing

**In Production/Fulfilled Orders**:

- Shows: Unfulfilled vs Fulfilled grouping
- Allows: No editing (locked)
- Displays: Tracking links for fulfilled items

---

## Testing the Complete System

### End-to-End Test

```bash
# 1. Find an order in production with Shopify remote IDs
rails console
> order = Order.where(aasm_state: 'in_production').where.not(shopify_remote_order_id: nil).first
> puts "Order ID: #{order.id}"
> exit

# 2. Create test fulfillment (triggers both inbound and outbound)
rails fulfillments:create_test[ORDER_ID]

# 3. Check activity log
rails fulfillments:list[ORDER_ID]

# Expected activities:
#  - "Fulfillment Created"
#  - "Fulfillment Synced to Shopify" ← NEW!

# 4. Verify in Shopify admin
# Go to: https://[STORE].myshopify.com/admin/orders/[ORDER_ID]
# Should see: Fulfillment with tracking info
```

### Manual Outbound Sync Test

```ruby
# In Rails console
fulfillment = Fulfillment.last

# Run outbound sync
service = OutboundFulfillmentService.new(fulfillment: fulfillment)
result = service.sync_to_shopify

# Check result
puts result[:success] ? "✓ Synced!" : "✗ Failed: #{result[:error]}"

# View activity
fulfillment.order.order_activities.where(activity_type: 'fulfillment_sync').last
```

---

## Error Handling

### Design Philosophy

**Fail Gracefully**: Outbound sync errors never prevent inbound fulfillments from being created

**Error Isolation**:

```ruby
# In InboundFulfillmentService
def sync_to_shopify(fulfillment)
  # ... sync logic ...
rescue StandardError => e
  Rails.logger.error "Outbound sync failed: #{e.message}"
  # Don't re-raise - inbound fulfillment still succeeds
end
```

### Error Tracking

All sync failures are:

- ✓ Logged to Rails logger
- ✓ Recorded as order activities
- ✓ Include error details in metadata
- ✓ Visible in order timeline

### Common Errors

| Error                         | Cause                                 | Solution                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| "No fulfillment orders found" | Order already fulfilled in Shopify    | Normal - order complete               |
| "No matching line items"      | Missing `shopify_remote_line_item_id` | Check OrderProductionService sets IDs |
| "Invalid line item ID"        | Line item doesn't exist in Shopify    | Verify order sync                     |
| GraphQL errors                | API/auth issues                       | Check token, scopes, API version      |

---

## Configuration

### Required Access Scopes

Configured in `/config/initializers/shopify_app.rb`:

```ruby
config.scope = "read_orders,write_orders,read_fulfillments,write_fulfillments"
```

**Scopes breakdown**:

- `read_orders` - Query fulfillment orders
- `write_fulfillments` - Create fulfillments
- `read_fulfillments` - Read fulfillment order details
- `write_orders` - (Already had this)

### Webhook Configuration

Add to `shopify.app.toml`:

```toml
[[webhooks.subscriptions]]
topics = ["fulfillments/create"]
uri = "/fulfillments/create"

[[webhooks.subscriptions]]
topics = ["fulfillments/update"]
uri = "/fulfillments/update"
```

### Routes

Both paths work for webhooks:

- `/fulfillments/create` ← Shopify sends here
- `/webhooks/fulfillments/create` ← Also works

---

## Activity Log Types

### New Activity Types

**fulfillment_sync** (success):

```ruby
{
  activity_type: "fulfillment_sync",
  title: "Fulfillment Synced to Shopify",
  description: "Fulfillment synced to Store Name with tracking ABC123 (2 items)",
  metadata: {
    shopify_fulfillment_id: "gid://shopify/Fulfillment/123",
    tracking_number: "ABC123",
    fulfillment_id: 42
  }
}
```

**fulfillment_sync_error** (failure):

```ruby
{
  activity_type: "fulfillment_sync_error",
  title: "Fulfillment Sync to Shopify Failed",
  description: "Failed to sync fulfillment to Store Name: error message",
  metadata: {
    error: "Detailed error message",
    fulfillment_id: 42
  }
}
```

### Existing Activity Types

**fulfillment** (inbound):

```ruby
{
  activity_type: "fulfillment",
  title: "Fulfillment Created",
  description: "2 items fulfilled via New Zealand Post (ABC123)"
}
```

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### View Sync Logs

```bash
# Development
tail -f log/development.log | grep -E "Inbound|Outbound|fulfillment"

# Production
tail -f log/production.log | grep fulfillment_sync
```

### Query Sync Success Rate

```ruby
# Total fulfillments
Fulfillment.count

# Fulfillments with sync success
OrderActivity.where(activity_type: 'fulfillment_sync').count

# Fulfillments with sync errors
OrderActivity.where(activity_type: 'fulfillment_sync_error').count

# Recent sync errors
OrderActivity.where(activity_type: 'fulfillment_sync_error')
  .recent.limit(10)
  .each { |a| puts "#{a.order.display_name}: #{a.description}" }
```

### Manual Retry Failed Syncs

```ruby
# Find orders with failed syncs
failed_activities = OrderActivity
  .where(activity_type: 'fulfillment_sync_error')
  .where('occurred_at > ?', 1.day.ago)

failed_activities.each do |activity|
  fulfillment_id = activity.metadata['fulfillment_id']
  fulfillment = Fulfillment.find(fulfillment_id)

  puts "Retrying fulfillment ##{fulfillment_id}..."
  service = OutboundFulfillmentService.new(fulfillment: fulfillment)
  result = service.sync_to_shopify

  puts result[:success] ? "  ✓ Success!" : "  ✗ Failed: #{result[:error]}"
end
```
