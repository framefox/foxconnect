# Shopify Fulfillment System - Implementation Complete ✓

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✓ Fully Implemented and Ready for Testing

---

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a complete Shopify-style fulfillment tracking system with:

- Multiple fulfillments per order support
- Partial/split shipment handling
- Carrier and tracking information storage
- Automatic order state transitions
- Shopify-style UI with conditional grouping

---

## What You Can Do Now

### 1. Test with Rake Tasks

```bash
# Create a test fulfillment for an entire order
rails fulfillments:create_test[ORDER_ID]

# Create a partial fulfillment (only 2 items)
rails fulfillments:create_partial[ORDER_ID,2]

# List all fulfillments for an order
rails fulfillments:list[ORDER_ID]
```

### 2. Test the UI

1. Navigate to an order in `in_production` state: `/orders/:id`
2. You'll see the new fulfillment-based grouping:

   - **Unfulfilled section** (yellow) - Items awaiting fulfillment
   - **Fulfilled sections** (green) - One per fulfillment with tracking

3. For draft/cancelled orders, you'll see the original grouping:
   - **To be fulfilled by Framefox** (green)
   - **Not Fulfilled by Framefox** (gray)

### 3. Receive Real Shopify Webhooks

The system is ready to receive webhooks from Shopify:

- Endpoint: `POST /webhooks/fulfillments/create`
- Endpoint: `POST /webhooks/fulfillments/update`

---

## Database Changes

### New Tables

**fulfillments** (12 columns)

- Stores fulfillment records from Shopify
- Tracks carrier, tracking number, tracking URL
- Links to orders

**fulfillment_line_items** (5 columns)

- Junction table linking fulfillments to order items
- Supports partial quantities

### Indexes Added

- `fulfillments.shopify_fulfillment_id` (unique)
- `fulfillment_line_items.[fulfillment_id, order_item_id]` (unique)

---

## New Order States

### AASM State Machine Updated

```ruby
draft → in_production → fulfilled
  ↓           ↓
cancelled   cancelled
```

**fulfilled state:**

- Automatically triggered when all items are fulfilled
- Can only transition from `in_production`
- Guard: `fully_fulfilled?` must return true

---

## Key Components

### Models

**Fulfillment**

- `belongs_to :order`
- `has_many :fulfillment_line_items`
- `has_many :order_items, through: :fulfillment_line_items`
- Methods: `tracking_info_present?`, `carrier_and_tracking`, `item_count`

**FulfillmentLineItem**

- `belongs_to :fulfillment`
- `belongs_to :order_item`
- Validates quantity doesn't exceed order item quantity

**Order** (enhanced)

- `has_many :fulfillments`
- New state: `fulfilled`
- Methods: `fulfillment_status`, `fulfilled_items_count`, `unfulfilled_items_count`, `fully_fulfilled?`

**OrderItem** (enhanced)

- `has_many :fulfillment_line_items`
- Methods: `fulfilled_quantity`, `unfulfilled_quantity`, `fully_fulfilled?`, `partially_fulfilled?`

### Services

**FulfillmentService**

- `create_fulfillment` - Processes webhook data, creates fulfillment records
- `update_fulfillment` - Updates existing fulfillments
- Matches line items via `shopify_remote_line_item_id`
- Logs activities
- Auto-updates order state

### Controllers

**Webhooks::FulfillmentsController**

- `POST create` - Handles fulfillments/create webhook
- `POST update` - Handles fulfillments/update webhook
- JSON parsing and error handling
- Webhook verification placeholder (implement HMAC for production)

---

## UI Features

### Conditional Display Logic

**For draft/cancelled orders:**

- Shows items grouped by fulfillment-enabled status
- Preserves original workflow

**For in_production/fulfilled orders:**

- Shows items grouped by fulfillment status
- Unfulfilled items appear first
- Each fulfillment shown in separate green section

### Fulfillment Display

Each fulfillment section shows:

- ✓ Fulfilled (X) badge with count
- Location badge (e.g., "Framefox HQ")
- Fulfillment ID in top-right
- Date fulfilled
- Carrier and tracking info with clickable link
- List of items with quantities

Example:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Fulfilled (2)  📍 Framefox HQ        #123 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 📅 October 13, 2025                          │
│ 🚚 New Zealand Post tracking:                │
│    0079421039261693147 (clickable)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Lennon Skinny Framed Print                  │
│ Qty: 1 × $139.00                            │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────────── │
│ Mayfield Float Framed Canvas                │
│ Qty: 1 × $179.00                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Testing Utilities

### Rake Tasks Created

```ruby
# lib/tasks/fulfillments.rake

rails fulfillments:create_test[order_id]
  → Creates full test fulfillment with all items

rails fulfillments:create_partial[order_id,count]
  → Creates partial fulfillment with N items

rails fulfillments:list[order_id]
  → Lists all fulfillments for an order
```

---

## Production Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Implement HMAC webhook verification in `webhooks/fulfillments_controller.rb`
- [ ] Add `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to environment variables
- [ ] Subscribe to `fulfillments/create` webhook in Shopify
- [ ] Subscribe to `fulfillments/update` webhook in Shopify
- [ ] Test with real Shopify store in development
- [ ] Verify `shopify_remote_line_item_id` is set on all order items
- [ ] Monitor webhook delivery in production logs

## Important Notes

### Webhook Matching

The system matches Shopify line items to local order items using `shopify_remote_line_item_id`. This field must be set during order import or when sending to production.

**Already implemented in `OrderProductionService`:**

```ruby
order_item.update(shopify_remote_line_item_id: line_item_id)
```

### State Transitions

The `fulfilled` state is **automatically** triggered when:

1. Order is in `in_production` state
2. A fulfillment is created (via webhook or manually)
3. All active order items are fully fulfilled
4. FulfillmentService checks and calls `order.fulfill!` if conditions met

### Partial Fulfillments

Fully supported:

- Item with qty 3 can be fulfilled as: 1 + 1 + 1 (three separate fulfillments)
- Or: 2 + 1 (two fulfillments)
- Each fulfillment tracked independently
- UI shows unfulfilled quantity remaining

---

> puts "Order ID: #{order.id}"
> exit

# 2. Create a test fulfillment
rails fulfillments:create_test[THAT_ORDER_ID]

# 3. View the order
# Open browser: http://localhost:3000/orders/THAT_ORDER_ID
