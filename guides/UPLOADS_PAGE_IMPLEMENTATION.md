# Uploads Page Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a dedicated "Uploads" page in the sidebar navigation that allows users to manage their uploaded images with upload, search, preview, and delete (UI only) functionality.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Routes (`config/routes.rb`)
Added uploads resource route:
```ruby
resources :uploads, only: [ :index ]
```

#### Controller (`app/controllers/uploads_controller.rb`)
Created `UploadsController` with an `index` action that simply renders the view. All data fetching is handled by the React component via external API calls.

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### View (`app/views/uploads/index.html.erb`)
Created the uploads index view with:
- Page header with title and description
- React component mount point for `UploadsManager`
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application

#### React Components

**UploadsManager.js** (`app/javascript/components/UploadsManager.js`)
Main component for managing uploads with:
- Upload functionality using existing `Uploader` component
- Search bar for filtering artworks by filename
- Grid display of uploaded images
- Click handler to open preview modal
- Delete button (UI only, not hooked up to backend)
- Fetches artworks from: `/shopify-customers/${shopifyCustomerId}/images.json`
- Uses `window.FramefoxConfig` for API configuration

Key Features:
- Toggle upload interface with "Upload a new file" / "Cancel Upload" button
- Real-time search filtering
- Loading and error states
- Responsive grid layout (1/2/3 columns based on screen size)
- Each artwork card shows:
  - Image thumbnail
  - Filename
  - Image ID and key
  - Dimensions
  - Delete button (placeholder)

**ImagePreviewModal.js** (`app/javascript/components/ImagePreviewModal.js`)
Modal component for viewing image details:
- Fetches full image data from: `/shopify-customers/${shopifyCustomerId}/images/${imageId}.json`
- Displays large image preview
- Shows comprehensive metadata:
  - Filename
  - Image ID and key
  - Dimensions
  - File size (formatted as MB/KB)
  - Format
  - Host
  - Upload date
- Loading and error states
- Close button and overlay click to dismiss

#### Navigation (`app/views/shared/_sidebar.html.erb`)
Added "Uploads" navigation item to sidebar:
- Positioned between "Stores" and "Help / FAQ"
- Uses `UploadIcon` for both active and inactive states
- Active state when path starts with "/uploads"

## Features

### Completed
✅ Dedicated uploads page accessible from sidebar
✅ Upload new images using existing Uploader component
✅ Search/filter images by filename
✅ Grid display of all uploaded images
✅ Click to preview image with full details
✅ Delete button UI (placeholder for future implementation)

### Pending (For Future Implementation)
⏳ Delete endpoint hookup - Currently shows alert "Delete functionality coming soon"
⏳ Batch operations (select multiple, bulk delete, etc.)
⏳ Image usage tracking (show which products/orders use each image)
