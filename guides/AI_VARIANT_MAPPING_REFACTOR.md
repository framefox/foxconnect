# AI Variant Mapping Refactor - Dedicated Controller

## Overview

Refactored the AI variant mapping feature to use a dedicated controller instead of bloating the products controller. This improves code organization and follows Rails best practices for separation of concerns.

## Changes Made

### New Controller Created

**File**: `app/controllers/connections/stores/ai_variant_mappings_controller.rb`

A dedicated controller specifically for AI variant mapping operations:

- Handles AI suggestion generation
- Manages batch creation of variant mappings
- Properly scoped to products via nested routing
- Clean, focused responsibility

### Routes Updated

**File**: `config/routes.rb`

Changed from member routes on products to a nested resource:

**Before**:

```ruby
resources :products, only: [:show] do
  member do
    post :ai_suggest_mappings
    post :ai_create_mappings
  end
end
```

**After**:

```ruby
resources :products, only: [:show] do
  member do
    # existing routes...
  end

  resource :ai_variant_mapping, only: [], controller: "stores/ai_variant_mappings" do
    post :suggest, on: :collection
    post :create, on: :collection
  end
end
```

**New Routes**:

- `POST /connections/stores/:store_id/products/:product_id/ai_variant_mapping/suggest`
- `POST /connections/stores/:store_id/products/:product_id/ai_variant_mapping`

### Products Controller Cleaned Up

**File**: `app/controllers/connections/stores/products_controller.rb`

Removed AI-related actions:

- Removed `ai_suggest_mappings` action
- Removed `ai_create_mappings` action
- Removed from before_action filters
- Controller is now focused purely on product operations

### Frontend Updated

**File**: `app/javascript/components/AiVariantMappingModal.js`

Updated API endpoint URLs:

- Changed `/products/:id/ai_suggest_mappings` to `/products/:product_id/ai_variant_mapping/suggest`
- Changed `/products/:id/ai_create_mappings` to `/products/:product_id/ai_variant_mapping`

## Benefits

1. **Better Code Organization**: AI-related logic is now isolated in its own controller
2. **Easier to Maintain**: Changes to AI functionality don't touch the products controller
3. **RESTful Design**: Uses proper nested resource structure
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add more AI-related actions without cluttering products controller
5. **Clear Responsibility**: Each controller has a single, well-defined purpose

## No Breaking Changes

- All functionality remains exactly the same
- Frontend seamlessly updated to use new routes
- No database changes required
- No user-facing changes

## Testing

All existing tests should pass. The refactor is purely organizational with no functional changes.
