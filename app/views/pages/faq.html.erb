              question: "How do I install Framefox Connect?",
              answer: "Framefox Connect is invite-only right now, we'll set your account up and you'll receive a welcome email to get started. You'll be guided through a quick setup process to connect your store and configure your preferences."
            },
            {
              question: "What's the difference between Framefox Connect and Framefox Pro?",
              answer: "Framefox Pro is the artist drop-shipping service for artists and photographers. Framefox Pro requires manual ordering, Framefox Connect is fully automated. The product range, pricing and customisation options are identical. "
            },
            {
              question: "What permissions does the app require?",
              answer: "Framefox Connect requires access to your products, orders and fulfillments (to update tracking information). We only access the minimum data necessary to provide our service."
            },
            {
              question: "How long does it take to set up?",
              answer: "It depends on the number of products and variants in your store and how long it takes to map your products to ours. You also have the option to skip mapping all of your products in advance which will speed up the setup process but means some extra work when orders are imported."
            },
            {
              question: "Can I use Framefox Connect with multiple stores?",
              answer: "Yes, you can connect multiple Shopify stores to a single Framefox Connect account. Each store is managed independently with its own product catalog and order history."

            {
              question: "Which products can I fulfill through Framefox?",
              answer: "Framefox specializes in custom framed prints and canvas prints. You can fulfill any product that involves printing artwork and optionally adding professional framing. Our variant mapping system makes it easy to match your product variants to our print sizes."
            },
            {
              question: "How does variant mapping work?",
              answer: "Variant mapping connects your Shopify product variants (like \"Large Black Frame\") to Framefox print sizes and frame options. You can map variants manually or use our AI-powered tool to automatically suggest the best matches based on your variant names."
            },
            {
              question: "Can I enable fulfillment for only some products?",
              answer: "Absolutely! You have complete control over which products are fulfilled by Framefox. You can toggle fulfillment on/off at both the product and individual variant level."
            },
            {
              question: "What happens if a customer orders a product that isn't mapped?",
              answer: "If an order contains unmapped variants, you'll be notified and can map them before submitting the order for production. The order will remain in a pending state until all variants are properly mapped."
            },
            {
              question: "How do I update my product catalog?",
              answer: "Your product catalog syncs automatically whenever you add, update, or remove products in Shopify. You can also trigger a manual sync at any time from the store settings page."

            },
            {
              question: "When am I charged for fulfillment?",
              answer: "You're charged for fulfillment within 24 hours of submitting an order for production. Orders imported from Shopify are not charged until you review and explicitly submit them through the Framefox Connect dashboard."
            },
            {
              question: "Can I cancel an order after submitting it?",

              answer: "Refunds are handled between you and your customer. If the issue is due to a production error on our end, we'll reprint the order at no charge. For customer preference refunds, standard fulfillment costs still apply."

              answer: "First, check that your store is connected and active in the Framefox Connect dashboard. If the issue persists, try triggering a manual sync. If products still don't appear, contact our support team for assistance."
            },
            {
              question: "Why isn't my order importing from Shopify?",
              answer: "Orders only import if they contain products that have fulfillment enabled in Framefox Connect. Also ensure your store connection is active. Check the order status in Shopify to confirm it's marked as paid."
            },
            {
              question: "How do I disconnect my store?",
              answer: "You can disconnect your Shopify store at any time from the store settings page. Note that disconnecting will stop order imports and you won't be able to fulfill new orders until you reconnect."
