              question: "Which products can I fulfill through Framefox?",
              answer: "Framefox specializes in custom framed prints and canvas prints. You can fulfill any product that involves printing artwork and optionally adding professional framing. Our variant mapping system makes it easy to match your product variants to our print sizes."
            },
            {
              question: "How does variant mapping work?",
              answer: "Variant mapping connects your Shopify product variants (like \"Large Black Frame\") to Framefox print sizes and frame options. You can map variants manually or use our AI-powered tool to automatically suggest the best matches based on your variant names."

            {
              question: "Can I enable fulfillment for only some products?",

            {
              question: "What happens if a customer orders a product that isn't mapped?",
              answer: "If an order contains unmapped variants, you'll be notified and can map them before submitting the order for production. The order will remain in a pending state until all variants are properly mapped."
            },
            {
              question: "How do I update my product catalog?",
              answer: "Your product catalog syncs automatically via webhooks whenever you add, update, or remove products in Shopify. You can also trigger a manual sync at any time from the store settings page."

              question: "When am I charged for fulfillment?",

              question: "Can I cancel an order after submitting it?",

              question: "What if a customer wants a refund?",

            {
              question: "How do I track my fulfillment expenses?",

              answer: "First, check that your store is connected and active in the Framefox Connect dashboard. If the issue persists, try triggering a manual sync. If products still don't appear, contact our support team for assistance."
            },
            {
              question: "Why isn't my order importing from Shopify?",
              answer: "Orders only import if they contain products that have fulfillment enabled in Framefox Connect. Also ensure your store connection is active and webhooks are configured properly. Check the order status in Shopify to confirm it's marked as paid."

            {
              question: "How do I disconnect my store?",
              answer: "You can disconnect your Shopify store at any time from the store settings page. Note that disconnecting will stop order imports and you won't be able to fulfill new orders until you reconnect."
